  Hi, my name's Michael and I am a people manager, a clinical data expert and a digital reformer. What does this mean?

#   Well, I have a background as a technical developer, with focus on automation, data science and digitalization of processes.
# On top of that, I have reached the specialist role within Clinical Data Standards, which means I have extensive expertise in 
# CDISC standards (SDTM, ODM, controlled terminology). 

# More recently, my vision and talent for leadership have made me become a people manager with 10+ direct reports. 

# You can find my CV here, while here below you will find a few more details some of my projects.

 # I am most skilled in: <mark>digitalization</mark>, <mark>clinical data management</mark>, and <mark>leadership</mark>.

#   title: Leadership
#   description: As a people leader, I ensure the team is motivated and competent by providing feedback and building trust. 
#
# I believe a true leader inspires and motivates their team to achieve their goals. 
# They lead by example and are always willing to lend a helping hand. 
# A true leader listens to their team members, encourages their ideas, 
# and provides them with opportunities to grow and develop. 
# They also take responsibility for their actions and decisions,
#  and are always looking for ways to improve themselves and their team.
#
#   quote: > 
# "It is the strong leader that allows people to see when they are weak." cit. Simon Sinek.

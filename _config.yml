  Hi, my name is Michael and I am a people manager, a clinical data expert and a digital reformer ðŸ’¥ 

  What does this combination mean? 

  Well, I have a background as a technical developer, with focus on automation, data science and digitalization of processes. 
  On top of that, I have reached the specialist role within Clinical Data Standards, which means I have extensive expertise in 
  CDISC standards (SDTM, ODM, and controlled terminology). 

  More recently, my vision and attitude for leadership have made me become a people manager with 10+ direct reports. 

  You can find my CV here, while here below you will find a few more details of some of my projects.
# I am most skilled in: <mark>digitalization</mark>, <mark>clinical data management</mark>, and <mark>leadership</mark>.

          As a team leader, I automated a request management process using Microsoft 
          PowerApps and Power Automate, resulting in greater efficiency and hundreds 
          of successful requests managed, showcasing my ability to quickly identify 
          and implement process improvements.

          This project involved using Microsoft PowerApps and Power Automate to improve the 
          efficiency of a request management process. The project consisted of creating an interface 
          using PowerApps to gather necessary input from stakeholders, and using Power Automate to 
          process the input and send emails to both the team in charge and the requester. 
          Additionally, a task management system was created using Microsoft Planner to make 
          it easier for the team to manage requests and provide an overview to management.
          
          This project was initiated by me within one month of starting my role as team leader. 
          The automated process has since been used for hundreds of requests, 
          demonstrating my ability to quickly identify opportunities for 
          process improvement and automation to achieve greater efficiency.

          I created a valuable Excel 
          tool that fetched data from multiple databases, saving stakeholders time 
          and effort, and highlighting my technical skills and vision.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project involved writing SQL scripts to extract data from multiple 
          databases and displaying the extracted data in a user-friendly and filterable Excel tool, 
          utilizing both VBA and SQL. The tool proved to be highly successful, 
          with over 100 end-users across various stakeholders using it for more than five years. 
          
          The popularity and longevity of the tool demonstrate my technical 
          skills and ability to create solutions that meet the needs of a wide range of end-users.
